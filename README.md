# Enter The Matrix
https://andresnalegre.github.io/Enter-The-Matrix/

## Overview  
A little project inspired by the iconic *Matrix* “digital rain” effect. Simple, but it brings that feeling of plugging into the Matrix with falling characters and ambient audio to set the mood.

## Features  
- Matrix-style falling code animation.
- Intro messages for that “wake up, Neo…” vibe.
- Subtle social links fade in after the animation.

## Tech  
- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript.

## Inspiration  
Inspired by *The Matrix* and [Jason Charney’s CodePen](https://codepen.io/jrcharney/pen/ExwbZGd). A nod to his awesome digital rain work.
